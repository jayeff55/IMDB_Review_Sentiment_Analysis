# IMDB Movie Review: Sentiment Analysis
This project involves creating a series of Natural Language Processing (NLP) neural network (NN) models capable of classifying sentiment i.e. positive/negative of movie reviews

## Overview
Applied various NN architectures, namely:
- Fully connected dense neural network
- Convolutional (1D) neural network
- Simple Recurrent (RNN) neural network
- Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) recurrent neural network
- Stacked Bi-directional simple RNN
- Non-sequential multi convolutional neural network
